# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Usin-ANN
This case study is based on the very famous dataset in machine learning. The titanic survival data.

The data contains information about 891 passengers. It also indicates whether the passenger survived the titanic crash or not?

The goal is to create a predictive model which can predict the survival of a given person, if they were to board the titanic and the ship sinks... again!

In below case study I will discuss the step by step approach to create a  classification Machine Learning predictive model using ANN.
